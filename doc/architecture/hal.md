# 🔧 Architecture Note — hal

## Historical developments
TaskMate began as AVR-centric code, then `v0.21` separated architecture, MCU, and board ownership.
This progressively removed hardware detail from sysCore and clarified target-specific boundaries.

After tag `v0.28`, the repository introduced reusable external drivers and moved target GPIO wiring.
Commit `b201809` completed the HAL/GPIO refactor; tag `v0.29` recorded the Make and HAL baseline.

Generic driver contracts later moved to `interfaces/`; HAL retained selection and implementation.

## Current implementation
The only implemented stack is `avr8 / atmega2560 / arduinoMega`, selected by `test1`:

- architecture code owns context, stack, interrupt, atomic, startup, and halt mechanisms;
- MCU code owns GPIO, I2C, USART, timers, startup, and AVR text/output support;
- board code provides the Arduino Mega startup hook;
- reusable drivers implement the AMC2004 LCD and ZS042 RTC contracts.

Public HAL headers still select most architecture or MCU mechanisms. The halt contract and generic
driver APIs come from neutral interfaces and are bound to selected target sources. Before
scheduling, generated calls initialize architecture, MCU, board, then target hooks before logical
GPIO initialization.
USART still starts earlier as the boot-log path. Once scheduled, the system service starts other
drivers by run level through syscalls and checks their running state before advancing.

LCD and USART output contracts transport `uint8_t` bytes. Their display paths are reserved for boot
or normal thread context and must never be called from an ISR. In particular, an LCD byte sequence
holds one I2C transaction from write start through write end; the syscall layer owns that sequencing
and finalizes a started transaction after either success or failure. Reentrancy is intentionally not
part of the contract until locking is added.

The current MCU still exposes string reads and formatted-output transport through a public tmLibc
backend. Under the v10 direction, libc sits above `sysCall`; future work must replace this direct
library-to-HAL route while preserving AVR program-memory handling and bounded output.

## Well-built code and implementation weaknesses
### Strengths
- CPU context, interrupts, timers, and registers remain inside target-specific code.
- Public selectors reject unavailable mechanisms at compile time.
- The build-selected startup order is explicit, generated, and covered by host tests.
- Registered drivers share one bounded life-cycle and status contract.

### Remaining weaknesses
- Driver capability requirements remain implicit in selected sources and `init.rc` names.
- The public tmLibc backend preserves a legacy `tmLibc` -> HAL dependency.
- Startup hooks are empty; USART and scheduler timers still follow special initialization paths.
- Start requests discard driver results, and startup cannot unwind a partial hardware state.
