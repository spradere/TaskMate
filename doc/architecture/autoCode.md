# 👨‍💻 Architecture Note — autoCode

## Historical developments
`autoCode` replaced manual allocation and include glue around `v0.10`. It gained `init.rc` parsing
in `v0.20`, then learned the architecture/MCU/board split in `v0.21`.

Revisions `v0.24` to `v0.26` added options, tagged replacement, temporary files, and diagnostics.
After tag `v0.28`, the system/user/HAL reorganisation changed inputs without changing its role.

Commit `bd42774` deferred destination replacement until parsing succeeds; `22c6781` then made
bounded line truncation explicit. Commit `79ac629` removed `FLOW` messages from firmware ROM.

Commits `bd9272d` and `70ef58e` added bounded diagnostic accumulation and file-error propagation.
Commit `a2a7c65` integrated black-box and sanitizer test targets for the host generator.
Commit `e1d320a` generated the selected startup calls; `8951952` versioned the `init.rc` grammar.

## Current implementation
`bmake` compiles `srcs/autoCode/` as a host tool and gives it selected system, HAL, and target input
lists. It:

- parses typed module entries, run levels, and optional driver I2C addresses;
- requires each module to declare at least one valid `-source_file` or `-source_dir` path;
- aggregates error declarations and their `FLOW`, `WARN`, `FAIL`, or `PANIC` level;
- reads selected startup headers and functions plus logical GPIO declarations;
- rewrites tagged module, error, GPIO, HAL include, and ordered startup-call regions.

Every `init.rc` starts with the supported major and minor syntax versions on its first two physical
lines. Missing, misplaced, malformed, or unsupported headers reject generation before publication.
Source options may be repeated and mixed on one module. The build extracts the same declarations
to form its explicit compilation list, while autoCode validates that each referenced file or
directory exists below the configured source root.

Malformed records accumulate diagnostics up to a configured bound, then fail at phase boundaries.
Destinations are generated as registered temporary files, cleaned on failure, and compared and
replaced only after every input and required tag has passed validation.

Generated data fixes module records, stacks, contexts, run levels, driver callbacks, errors, GPIO
identifiers, selected includes, and startup order. Black-box targets exercise command options,
syntax versions, single and repeated source declarations, catalogues, module inputs, tags, line
bounds, stable replacement, and failure isolation; a separate target runs the corpus with address
and undefined-behaviour sanitizers.

## Well-built code and implementation weaknesses
### Strengths
- Required options and output tags are checked; invalid data prevents destination replacement.
- Syntax versions, modules, errors, startup lists, and GPIO data are validated before compilation.
- Fixed generated records avoid runtime registration and dynamic allocation in the firmware.
- Generation and its host-side tests are build-integrated and deterministic on stable inputs.

### Remaining weaknesses
- Replacement has no rollback if a filesystem operation fails after an earlier rename.
- Tests do not inject real open, close, remove, or rename failures and provide no fuzz coverage.
- Syntax compatibility is exact; no migration path exists between supported `init.rc` versions.
- Input discovery order and host tool versions are not captured in a generation manifest.
