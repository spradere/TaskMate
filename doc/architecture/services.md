# 🧩 Architecture Note — services

## Historical developments
Services introduced reusable system threads above the kernel, initially including a message service
and serial CLI. The message service was later removed as the system service took its role.

After tag `v0.28`, services moved under `srcs/system/services`. Commit `5109e98` put SCLI USART RX
behind sysCall, and later cooperative yield shortened deliberate polling waits.

Commits `c843372` and `35f329d` moved boot work to `TaskMate.c`, then staged startup to `system`.

## Current implementation
autoCode always registers the core-level `system` thread. The default `test1` composition also
registers the service-level `scli` thread; `test_noscli` selects the same hardware without it. Every
selected service has a fixed stack and declares itself initialized through sysCall at entry.

The system service starts drivers one run level at a time, triggers I2C discovery, stores the RTC
startup date, then waits for driver and thread readiness before enabling the next level. It reads
the RTC, updates the LCD, and cooperatively waits on its software counter.

SCLI reads USART through sysCall into a fixed buffer and dispatches `date`, `driver`, `i2c`, and
`thread`. The date command reads or updates RTC fields and can display the captured startup date.
Services consume neutral interfaces and the horizontal `tmLibc` layer. Both relations are explicit
in the v10 dependency matrix.

## Well-built code and implementation weaknesses
### Strengths
- Selected service records, stacks, command tables, and buffers have fixed memory costs.
- Startup follows explicit core, driver, service, and user stages with bounded readiness rounds.
- Both services and all command handlers preserve the service -> sysCall boundary.
- RTC command errors are translated through the generated error catalogue.

### Remaining weaknesses
- Startup discards I2C-scan, RTC-snapshot, and individual driver start results.
- Thread readiness is self-declared, with no richer health or dependency state.
- The display loop still ignores RTC/LCD errors and provides no recovery policy.
- SCLI processes RX chunks rather than complete lines and silently truncates excess arguments.
